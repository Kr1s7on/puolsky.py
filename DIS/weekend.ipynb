    "This document outlines a live demo for debugging an email validation script in Python using `pdb`, Python's built-in debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Introduce the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The script, `example.py`, is designed to validate that an input email address contains both an \"@\" character and a \".\" *after* the \"@\" but contains a logical error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Initial Run\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute `example.py` and test with various email addresses to demonstrate the bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Valid email: \"name@example.com\"\n",
    "- Invalid email that gets incorrectly validated: \"first.name@example\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Start a `pdb` Session\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin debugging, insert the following line at the start of the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, run the script with `pdb` from the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m pdb example.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Use `pdb` to Identify the Bug\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `pdb` commands to step through the execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n` (next): Move to the next line.\n",
    "- `p variable_name` (print): Inspect variable states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify that the script incorrectly slices the email string before the \"@\" character to check for a dot, leading to improper validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Pinpoint the Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The error lies in the logic checking for the dot's presence. The script should check the substring after the \"@\" character.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Correct the Bug\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the script to correctly slice the email string after the \"@\" character:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Corrected slicing\n",
    "domain_part = email[index+1:]  # Focus on the part after \"@\"\n",
    "\n",
    "if '.' in domain_part:\n",
    "    is_valid = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: Verify the Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove or comment out `pdb.set_trace()` and rerun the script to demonstrate the successful fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 8: Wrap-Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclude the demo by summarizing the debugging steps taken, emphasizing the value of `pdb` in the debugging process, and encouraging questions and further discussion on debugging strategies and techniques."
